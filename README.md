# Practical-business-case-code-demo

Welcome to my continuously expanding business-friendly sample project collections. Contents shared are my originals, involving large amounts of readings and experiments based on original documentations from highly appreciated module providers. For ease of reading, projects are organized in following folders:

‘Bert-Text Classification’: Create a text classification model using a pre-trained BERT module to predict whether or not an email is spam, the model outperforms the bi-directional LSTM model shown in other work samples. The work was conducted separately using the legacy TensorFlow 1.0, the newest Tensorflow 2.0 as well as the popular PyTorch, which makes it flexible for various system requirements.

‘LSTM-Text Classification’: Create a text classification model using LSTM network to predict whether or not an email is spam. A text generation technique is also being implemented here to deal with the data imbalance challenge.

‘Topic modeling’: Use three major LDA modeling implementations finding topics hidden in ‘20-news-group’ data and discuss the pro and cons of each approach.

‘Large Document Summarization’: Using 'TextRank' based algorithm to text summarizations for large financial documents.

‘Churn modeling’: Implement Decision tree modeling in the area of customer churn analysis.

‘Recommender Engine’: 
    Building a simple recommendation engine for an UK online merchandise based on its transactional data. A powerful graph data architecture and a random-walk driven algorithm (personalized pagerank algorithm-PPR) is selected to achieve this goal.
    Implement basket analysis for a streaming program to understand program bundle viewership during a subscriber’s tenure.
